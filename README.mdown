# FlexSlider 2.6.0
http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/ - Copyright (c) 2015 WooThemes

I've done nothing but add two lines of code that disable navigation buttons when they have the disabled class (the adding/removing of the disabled class is already a feature of FlexSlider, but it is irrelevant when clicked; there's no reason why a button with the disabled class should have its normal behavior).

Please see https://github.com/woothemes/FlexSlider for all documentation.
